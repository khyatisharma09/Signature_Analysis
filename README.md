# Personality Analysis Using Signature

## Overview
This project leverages **machine learning** techniques to analyze and predict personality traits based on handwriting signatures. Built using **Python**, the model utilizes libraries like **NumPy**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras** to process and analyze signature images. By interpreting specific features of signatures, the project aims to uncover insights into personality traits, with applications in psychology, recruitment, and behavioral studies.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes input signature images for optimal analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts key characteristics such as size, slope, pressure, and curvature.
- **Model Training**: Deep learning models built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** analyze extracted features.
- **Prediction**: Classifies personality traits such as extroverted, introverted, conscientious, and more.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of predictions for better understanding.

## Libraries and Tools
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **Keras**: High-level API for TensorFlow, simplifying model development.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing results and feature analysis.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and feature extraction.
